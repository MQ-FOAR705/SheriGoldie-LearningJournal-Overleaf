\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{outlines}

\begin{document}
`this is a quote using single quotation marks'

"this is a quote that looks odd"

``this is a quote with double quotation marks''
%this is the best way to deal with double quotation marks in LaTeX without using any additional packages
% the ` is found on the tilde key - ~ on my keyboard it is at the top left next to 1/!






An alternative to this approach, which facilitates the production of nested lists is the outlines package. To produce a bulleted list with three levels it is as simple as

\begin{outline}
 \1 Top level item
   \2 Sub item
     \3 sub sub item
\end{outline}


To make a numbered list (as opposed to a bulleted list) one can simply pass the enumerate option to this package

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{outlines}
\begin{document}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
 \1 Top level item
   \2 Sub item
     \3 sub sub item
\end{outline}
\end{document}





\end{document}
